# nsr-mp, Narvik Student Radio Music Player
A project to make a radio music player based on gstreamer-java to play music and spots.

This is an IDLE radio player, its meant to play music, radiospots, update icecast while the radio staff does NOTHING.
The program will run on a server hidden somewhere, it loads music, spots, it even logs what has been played and then, updates icecast.
